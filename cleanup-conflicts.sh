# CLEANUP SCRIPT FOR CONFLICTING KAFKA/ZOOKEEPER CONFIGURATIONS
# =============================================================================
# This script removes existing Kafka and Zookeeper configurations that
# conflict with the new production setup.
# 
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Run this BEFORE deploying the production configuration
# - This will DELETE existing data if you choose to remove PVCs
# - Make sure you have backups if you need to preserve data
# - This script is idempotent - safe to run multiple times
